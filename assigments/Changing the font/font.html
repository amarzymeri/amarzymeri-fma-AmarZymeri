    <h1>Mufti Menk</h1>
    <p>
        Menk was born on 27 June 1975 in Salisbury to Gujarati Indian Muslim parents[11] from the Bharuchi Vohra Patel
        community.[12] He is the son of Maulana Musa Ibrahim Menk,
        a Muslim preacher in Zimbabwe.[12] Mufti Menk is able to speak Gujarati and Urdu[13] and undertook his initial
        studies with his father, memorizing the Quran and learning Arabic.[14] He went to St.
        John's College (Harare) for senior school.[15]
        He then completed his religious education and Mufti course from Kantharia Darul
        Uloom located in Gujarat, India.[16] and also in Madinah.[17] Menk has been identified as a Deobandi[15][18][19]
        as well as a Salafi[20] by different sources, though he has not publicly
        acknowledged his involvement in either movement.

        Menk opposes terrorism and has pledged his aid in curbing religious extremism in the Maldives.[21] On 31 March
        2018, he urged Liberian Muslims to avoid Muslimâ€”Christian violence, arguing that
        Muslims and Christians are brothers and sisters
        from one father, the prophet Adam.[22] He
        blames western media for misleading the world that Muslims are terrorists.[23]
        According to Gulf News, Menk said that everyone on this earth is a part of a family and has one maker,
        therefore, no one has the right to force any belief or faith on another.[24]
