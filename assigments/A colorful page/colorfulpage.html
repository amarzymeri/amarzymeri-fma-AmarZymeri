        Menk was born on 27 June 1975 in Salisbury to Gujarati Indian Muslim parents[11] from the Bharuchi Vohra Patel
        community.[12] He is the son of Maulana Musa Ibrahim Menk,
        a Muslim preacher in Zimbabwe.[12] Mufti Menk is able to speak Gujarati and Urdu[13] and undertook his initial
        studies with his father, memorizing the Quran and learning Arabic.[14] He went to St.
        John's College (Harare) for senior school.[15]
        He then completed his religious education and Mufti course from Kantharia Darul
        Uloom located in Gujarat, India.[16] and also in Madinah.[17] Menk has been identified as a Deobandi[15][18][19]
        as well as a Salafi[20] by different sources, though he has not publicly
        acknowledged his involvement in either movement.
        <br>
        Menk opposes terrorism and has pledged his aid in curbing religious extremism in the Maldives.[21] On 31 March
        2018, he urged Liberian Muslims to avoid Muslimâ€”Christian violence, arguing that
        Muslims and Christians are brothers and sisters
        from one father, the prophet Adam.[22] He
        blames western media for misleading the world that Muslims are terrorists.[23]
        According to Gulf News, Menk said that everyone on this earth is a part of a family and has one maker,
        therefore, no one has the right to force any belief or faith on another.[24]

        In September 2023, Mufti Menk visited Trinidad and Tobago during his special visits in the Caribbean.[25] MP
        Saddam Hosein, while sharing a Facebook post expressed that he is honored with a visit
        from an international beacon of peace and
        understanding.[26]
        On 31 October 2017, Singapore banned Menk from its borders because it believes he expresses
        views incompatible with its multicultural laws and policies. According to the Straits Times, he has asserted
        that
        "it is blasphemous for Muslims to greet believers of other faiths during festivals such as Christmas or
        Deepavali".
        <br>
        Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement that its decision to reject Menk's application for a
        short-term
        work pass stemmed from his "segregationist and divisive teachings".[34][35] The Majlisul Ulama Zimbabwe, Menk's
        own institution, released a statement to express "regret and dismay" regarding the ban.
        It said that Menk was an "asset to multi-cultural,
        multi-religious Zimbabwe" and that viewers should "listen to his sermons in full" and not "edited clips of a few
        minutes"
        to see the moderate path he has chosen.[36] Mufti Menk actually addressed this issue in a youtube video of his,
        in which he clarifies that he actually said, that you must not force your beliefs onto others.

        In November 2018, the Danish government banned Menk from entering its borders for 2 years.[37][38]
