    <h1>Hello There</h1>
    <p>
        Menk was born on 27 June 1975 in Salisbury to Gujarati Indian Muslim parents[11] from the Bharuchi
        Vohra Patel
        community.[12] He is the son of Maulana Musa Ibrahim Menk,
        a Muslim preacher in Zimbabwe.[12] Mufti Menk is able to speak Gujarati and Urdu[13] and undertook
        his initial
        studies with his father, memorizing the Quran and learning Arabic.[14] He went to St.
        John's College (Harare) for senior school.[15]
        He then completed his religious education and Mufti course from Kantharia Darul
        Uloom located in Gujarat, India.[16] and also in Madinah.[17] Menk has been identified as a
        Deobandi[15][18][19]
        as well as a Salafi[20] by different sources, though he has not publicly
        acknowledged his involvement in either movement.
